                    <p>We're delighted to have invited you to interview for our role of <span id="jobtitle" class="fw-bold">Graduate Digital Marketing Executive</span> at Founders Makers.</p>
                    <p>Our interviews take place in our office at the 180 Studio, at 2 Arundel Street, London, WC2R 3DA. We'll email through the exact time for your interview.</p>
                    <p>The interview process will take 45 minutes. Half of our interview will be a discussion about your past experience, your skills, and so on – your bog standard interview questions.</p>
                    <p>The second half will be more technical, where we'd like you to present on some (anonymised) data about a hypothetical client — <em>Purrfectly Yours</em>.</p>

                            <p><em>Purrfectly Yours</em> is a startup specialising in personalised D2C pet accessories, gifts, and toys.</p>
                            <p>In today's pet product market, there's a noticeable gap when it comes to truly unique and high-quality customized pet items. Generic, mass-produced pet products just don't capture the individuality of our beloved pets.</p>
                            <p>The UK pet market is thriving, with accessories estimated at a value between £0.9-1.5 billion. In a nation where 12 million households are proud pet owners, the total pet care market is valued at a staggering £6.5 billion, and it's still growing at 4% annually.</p>
                            <p>However, the pet accessories market is largely dominated by industry giants like Pets at Home and others who flood the market with mass-produced, lower-quality goods. Our smaller competition make high-quality for offline distributors, who take significant cuts of the profits. </p>
                            <p>This leaves a big gap for personalized and high-quality pet accessories. That's where <em>Purrfectly Yours</em> positions itself.</p>
                            <p>Their growth estimates are ambitious. By the end of the year, they aim to achieve £1 million in sales, and we're off to a promising start. We want you to help us review our business sales data, and find opportunities for us to grow as we come into Q4.</p>
